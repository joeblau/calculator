I created a quick concept of what a glass based user interface. The structure of the application is simple and the idea is to create the illusion of an application that would run on a piece of glass. We are years away from a prototype like this becoming a reality since holding the phone doesn't actually show your fingers behind the user interface. This app demo gives you an example of potentally how you could design a full glass interface.
